Building first Django app
This a basic app built with Django. The app takes the form of a web poll, and questions and multiple choice answers can be added.
The app then allows users to vote on a question using radio buttons to select a choice, submit the answer, and see the number of votes for each choice.

# Creating a new poll
This must be done using the admin interface. First, create a superuser, and then login in and click 'Questions' from the panel. To add new a poll click 'Add Question' in the top right hand side, and complete the form (define questions and choices) and click save.
